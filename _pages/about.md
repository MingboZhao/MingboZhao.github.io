I am an Assistant Professor at the School of Data Science, The Chinese University of Hong Kong (Shenzhen). I am also affiliated with Shenzhen Research Institute of Big data, Shenzhen, China. I was a Postdoctoral Associate at the School of Operations Research and Information Engineering, Cornell University, Ithaca, USA. I completed my PhD at City University of Hong Kong in Electronic Engineering, 2018, under the supervision of Prof. Tommy W.S. Chow (FIEEE). And during my PhD, I was a visiting scholar at the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Wisconsin-Madison, USA. I was a Research Assistant at The University of Hong Kong from 2013 to 2015. I obtained my Bachelor (Automation) and Master (Control Science and Engineering, supervisor: Youqing Wang) degrees from Beijing University of Chemical Technology in 2010 and 2013 respectively.

I am looking for PhD students, Postdocs, and Research Assistants. If you are interested in these positions, please send me your CV/resume. For PhD or Postdoc, please also send me your research plan.


Research Interests
======
My research interests include machine learning, computer vision, and optimization. I also worked on statistical process control and neuroscience signal/data processing. My research projects relate to:
* matrix and tensor methods
* algorithms for missing data, outlier, and noise
* recommendation system
* automated machine learning
* clustering algorithms
* learning with graphs
* non-smooth optimization
* anomaly/novelty detection
* process monitoring and fault diagnosis
* machine learning for bioinformatics and healthcare
* EEG and fMRI signal processing

See the examples in "Resarch" page.
